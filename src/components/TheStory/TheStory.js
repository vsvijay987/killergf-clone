                    Cerise is a woman of many faces. Yet by spy networks and
                    online sleuths, she is known only as the Killer GF assassin—
                    the uncatchable killer who has no true face. The secret to
                    her success lies in one supernatural gift. Wielding the
                    Mirror of Narcissus, she holds at her fingertips the ability
                    to reform her appearance into any disguises and powers using
                    this dark artifact. This mirror, which consumes both the
                    life essences and appearance of her kills, was a gift from
                    the Crimson God himself. A heirloom of sorts for his
                    favorite dearly beloved killer to better serve him by
                    carrying out the critical assassinations that bring down
                    societies, religions, and supernatural entities. Gods, even
                    with their gifts, can be cruel with jests that transcend
                    across the multiverse…

                    Knowing little of the trick inlaid within the Mirror, Cerise
                    used it once more. But this one, being the 7,777th time,
                    triggered a breakage of dimensions within the mirror,
                    pulling forth 7,777 versions of Cerise herself out into the
                    same dimension, wearing what appears to be every disguise
                    she has ever worn in the past for her kills.

                    Now that is a lot of deadly assassins in one room. But get
                    this, each being sentient and believing that she is the real
                    Cerise, they agree the only way to determine the one true
                    Cerise would be to participate in a game. A deadly set of
                    challenges within the metaverse where by playing and winning
                    hearts, the Cerises compete against each other using daring
                    and cunning tactics with only one coming out of it alive by
                    the end. They say the biggest enemy standing in your way is
                    yourself, but did they mean all 7,777?
