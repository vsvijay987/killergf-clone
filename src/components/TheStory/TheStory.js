                    We don't need to skip to the future, because we are the
                    future that generations before us envisaged. In a time when
                    the current world is fighting against unvouched aggressions
                    towards weaker countries, where rich are exploiting the
                    poor, where govts decide what we should do and what we
                    should not. It was time to bring in a better world, an era
                    of Renaissance. For centuries, GODS have been in hiding. Not
                    meddling with human development, silently shaping the world
                    as we know it, moulding the destinies of countless humans.
                    As inequality proliferated amongst the human race, the GODS
                    decided to lead the bandwagon of change where they would
                    soon reveal themselves, bringing about the dawn of new time.
                    The Age of Gods in the Renaissance.

                    Be a part of this journey with us as we mint them onto
                    blockchain and bring forward an adventure we won't be able
                    to keep our eyes off, replete with treasure hunts, P2E
                    games, art shows, giveaways,still helping the planet by
                    being eco-friendly and helping the marginalised strata of
                    society with the will of gods .While you own a piece of
                    journey with this close knit community into the new
                    renaissance let's remember again to be ourselves, to self
                    govern and find god inside each one of us.
